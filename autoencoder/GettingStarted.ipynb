    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have successfully installed DIGITS, this guide will teach you the basics of how to use it.\n",
    "By the end, you will have trained a Caffe model to recognize hand-written digits.\n",
    "We will be using the [MNIST handwritten digit database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist) as our dataset and [LeNet-5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/) for our network.\n",
    "Both are generously made available by Yann LeCun on [his website](http://yann.lecun.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Download the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following command to download the MNIST dataset onto your server:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ python -m digits.download_data mnist ~/mnist\n",

    "## Using the Webapp\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up a modern web browser, for example Chrome or Firefox, and navigate to the home screen of DIGITS.\n",
    "The server should be at either `http://localhost/` (if installed from Deb packages), or `http://localhost:5000/` (if using `digits-devserver`).\n",

    "### Logging in\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on `Datasets > New Dataset > Images > Classification`.\n",
    "This will lead you to the login page:\n",

    "### Creating a Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "After logging in, you will be brought to the \"New Image Classification Dataset\" page.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Type in the path to the MNIST training images\n",
    "  * You can also add the folder of MNIST test images as a \"Separate validation images folder\", if you like. Don't use the \"test images\" fields - test images are not used for anything in DIGITS yet.\n",
    "* Change the `Image Type` to `Grayscale`\n",
    "* Change the `Image size` to 28 x 28\n",
    "* Give the dataset a name\n",
    "* Click on the `Create` button\n",

    "While the job is running, you should see the expected completion time on the right side:\n",

    "\n",
    "When the job is finished, go back to the home page by clicking `DIGITS` in the top left hand part of the page.\n",
    "You should now see your dataset listed under the \"Datasets\" tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Home page with dataset](images/home-page-2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on `Models > New Model > Images > Classification`.\n",
    "This will lead you to the \"New Image Classification Model\" page.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, do the following:\n",
    "* Choose the \"MNIST\" dataset in the `Select Dataset` field\n",
    "* Choose the `LeNet` network in the `Standard Networks` tab\n",
    "* Give the model a name\n",
    "* Click on the `Create` button\n",
    "\n",
    "![New model](images/new-model.jpg)\n",

    "While training the model, you should see the expected completion time on the right side:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Training model](images/training-model.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the model, scroll to the bottom of the page.\n",
    "* Click on the `Upload image` button and choose a file\n",
    "  * There are plenty to choose from in `/home/username/mnist/test/`\n",
    "* Or, find an image on the web and paste the URL into the `Image URL` field\n",
    "* Check the `Show visualizations and statistics` box\n",
    "* Click on `Classify One`\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of the page, DIGITS displays the top five classifications and corresponding confidence values.\n",
    "DIGITS also provides visualizations and statistics about the weights and activations of each layer in your network.\n",
