    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "An image autoencoder may be used to learn a compressed representation of an image. An autoencoder comprises two parts:\n",
    "- an encoder, which learns a representation of the image, using fewer neurons than the input image\n",
    "- a decoder, which learns to reconstruct the original input from the compressed representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output layer of the encoder is the input layer of the decoder. This layer can be understood as a bottleneck that constrains the autoencoder to learn a compressed representation of the input.\n",
    "During training, the objective is to minimize the difference between the original input and the reconstructed input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "The autoencoder may be created in DIGITS by using a generic dataset and model. To create a generic dataset, DIGITS expects to be provided with a set of LMDB-encoded databases.\n",
    "If you followed the introductory walkthrough on [GettingStarted](GettingStarted.ipynb), you should have the MNIST dataset created in DIGITS already and DIGITS will have conveniently created the associated LMDB database and mean image file for you.\n",
    "Click on your MNIST image classification model to display dataset information: this will allow you to find the path to the job directory which includes the train database and mean image file:\n",
    "\n",
    "![MNIST image classification dataset](mnist-classification-dataset.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the path is `/workspace/jobs/20181225-050742-fd5b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to create a generic dataset that DIGITS can use to train a generic model on. To this avail, click on `New Dataset\\Images\\Other` on the main page:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Create generic dataset](create-generic-dataset.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the generic dataset creation form you need to provide the paths to the train database `/workspace/jobs/20181225-050742-fd5b/train_db` and the mean image `/workspace/jobs/20181225-050742-fd5b/mean.binaryproto`. Other fields can be left blank:\n",

    "![Create generic dataset form](create-generic-dataset-form.png)\n",

    "## Model creation (Torch)\n",

    "Now that you have a generic dataset to train on, you may create a generic model by clicking on `New Model\\Images\\Other` on the main page:\n",

    "This is the definition of a simple linear autoencoder which learns to compress an input of 784 nodes into a layer of just 50 nodes. Note how the model is symmetrically defined,\n",
    "with the encoder and decoder at opposite sides of the smallest layer of 50 nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is unsupervised training, a hook is required to tell DIGITS what to compare the network output against: here we are just setting the target label to be equal to\n",
