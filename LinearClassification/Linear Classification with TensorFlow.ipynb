    "When building a TF.Learn model, the input data is specified by means of an Input Builder function. This builder function will not be called until it is later passed to TF.Learn methods such as fit and evaluate. The purpose of this function is to construct the input data, which is represented in the form of [tf.Tensors](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor) or [tf.SparseTensors.](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/SparseTensor) In more detail, the Input Builder function returns the following as a pair:\n",

Because we want to call the *fit* and *evaluate* methods with different data, we define two different input builder functions, *train_input_fn* and *test_input_fn* which are identical except that they pass different data to *input_fn.* Note that *input_fn* will be called while constructing the TensorFlow graph, not while running the graph. What it is returning is a representation of the input data as the fundamental unit of TensorFlow computations, a *Tensor* (or *SparseTensor*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model represents the input data as **constant** tensors, meaning that the tensor represents a constant value, in this case the values of a particular column of *df_train* or *df_test.* This is the simplest way to pass data into TensorFlow. Another more advanced way to represent input data would be to construct an [Inputs And Readers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/io_ops#inputs_and_readers) that represents a file or other data source, and iterates through the file as TensorFlow runs the graph. Each continuous column in the train or test dataframe will be converted into a *Tensor,* which in general is a good format to represent dense data. For categorical data, we must represent the data as a *SparseTensor.* This data format is good for representing sparse data."

    "---\n",
    "Regularization is a technique used to avoid **overfitting.** Overfitting happens when your model does well on the data it is trained on, but worse on test data that the model has not seen before, such as live traffic. Overfitting generally occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observed training data. Regularization allows for you to control your model's complexity and makes the model more generalizable to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3 - Experiment with hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Linear Model library, you can add L1 and L2 regularizations to the model. One important difference between L1 and L2 regularization is that L1 regularization tends to make model weights stay at zero, creating sparser models, whereas L2 regularization also tries to make the model weights closer to zero but not necessarily zero. Therefore, if you increase the strength of L1 regularization, you will have a smaller model size because many of the model weights will be zero. This is often desirable when the feature space is very large but sparse, and when there are resource constraints that prevent you from serving a model that is too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try various combinations of L1, L2 regularization strengths and find the best parameters that best control overfitting and give you a desirable model size, starting with the baseline we've written for you below:"
